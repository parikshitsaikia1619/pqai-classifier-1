	"title": "Hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle for delivering cargo",
	"abstract": "Disclosed herein are aspects of a hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In one embodiment, the hybrid UAV includes a fuselage configured to hold cargo, and at least one wing. The wing has a body that includes upper and lower surfaces and is configured to generate lift to enable the UAV to glide through the air. At least one rotor assembly is held within the body of the wing between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. The upper and lower surfaces of the wing include upper and lower doors, respectively, extending above and below, respectively, the rotor assembly. The upper and lower doors are configured to be opened during gliding of the UAV to an open position that exposes the rotor assembly such that the rotor assembly is configured to draw air through the body of the wing and thereby generate lift."
